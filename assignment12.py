#Q.3-How http works?                

HTTP is a request response protocol to communicate asynchrnously between client and server.
Mostly in HTTP a browser acts as a client and a web-server like Apache or IIS acts as server.
The server which hosts the files (like html , audio , video files etc) responses to the client.
Depending on the request a response contains the status of the request.
HTTP has formalized on a few that capture the essentials that are universally applicable for all kinds of applications.

These request verbs are:

GET: fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all the necessary information the server needs to locate and return the resource.
POST: create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource.
PUT: update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource.
DELETE: delete an existing resource.
The above four verbs are the most popular, and most tools and frameworks explicitly expose these request verbs. PUT and DELETE are sometimes considered specialized versions of the POST verb, and they may be packaged as POST requests with the payload containing the exact action: create, update or delete.
